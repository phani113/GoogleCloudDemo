# GoogleCloudDemo



Deploying this application:

Deploy your application to App Engine using the gcloud app deploy command. This command automatically builds a container image by using the Cloud Build service and then deploys that image to the App Engine flexible environment. The container will include any local modifications that you've made to the runtime image.
